### Webcam Capture

1.  Delete all files in the `input/` folder 
2.  Run `python main.py`
3.  Pose and press 'q' to capture a picture
4.  Check the matplotlib output and see if the matched professional pose looks roughly the same as captured pose
    -   If the captured pose was not an impact pose, ignore
5.  Check the 3d plot to see if the green and red plots look similar

### Image input

1.  Delete all files in the `input/` folder 
2.  Run `python main.py`
3.  Pose and press 'c' to read from directory instead of capturing image
4.  Check the matplotlib output and see if the matched professional pose looks roughly the same as captured pose
    -   If the captured pose was not an impact pose, ignore
5.  Check the 3d plot to see if the green and red plots look similar
